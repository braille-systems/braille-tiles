# Braille Trainer : braille tiles

This repository is in the chain of Braille Trainer project

Braille tiles are educational cards with tactile Braille symbols to 
learn Braille alphabet. Characters are enlarged (three times larger than standard 
dimensions). In the back of each char there is a cutout in the shape of 
corresponding character in 'plain text'. Neighbouring tiles may 
be easily connected via small locks. On the left of each tile there is a 
separating threshold to help orientation.

**Tiles are designed for 3D-print and need no supports/rafts, but 
Braille dots are made with standard 4.5mm bullets for air gun that 
should be glued in openings**. Recommended layer height is <=0.1 mm. If 
you would like to just print-n-use, here in the repository you can find 
.sldprt SolidWorks source files and change revolved cuts to revolved 
extruded bodies (or write to me if you're unable to do this).

After creating these tiles I plan to make a system for Android that will 
use smartphone's camera to recognize Braille text and translate it to 
speech. Then it would be possible to make an educational application to
study Braille with this cards and smartphone or tablet device.
